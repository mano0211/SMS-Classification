# 📧 Email & SMS Spam Classifier using NLP + Machine Learning  
A complete end-to-end spam detection system built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Supervised Machine Learning**.  
This project can classify **email text** or **SMS messages** as either **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using TF-IDF features and multiple ML models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM).
